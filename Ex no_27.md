# EX 27 C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.

## Algorithm
Start.
Declare a variable value of type char.
Prompt the user to enter a value.
Read the value using scanf.
Check eligible for marriage.
If age >= 21, print "Eligible".
If false, print " Not Eligible".
End.
## Program:
```
